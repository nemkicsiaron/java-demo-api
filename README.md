# Java Demo REST API

## Overview

This project is a Java REST API built using the Spring Boot framework along with Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Jakarta EE, MySQL, Lombok, and Maven. It serves as a template for building robust and scalable backend services using Java.

## Features

- **RESTful API:** Utilizes REST principles for creating APIs, ensuring interoperability and scalability.
- **Spring Boot:** Provides a powerful framework for building Java-based applications with minimal configuration.
- **Spring Web:** Facilitates the development of web applications by providing essential features and utilities.
- **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies data access and manipulation by providing a high-level abstraction over JPA.
- **Jakarta EE:** Ensures compatibility and standardization for enterprise Java applications.
- **MySQL:** A widely-used relational database management system, offering stability and performance.
- **Lombok:** Reduces boilerplate code by automatically generating getters, setters, constructors, etc.
- **Maven:** Manages project dependencies and provides a uniform build system for Java projects.
